  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p> We looked at median home prices in all the areas listed on Zillow. We then multiplied this by 2/3 to get an estimate for a typical "starter home"</p>
  <p>We then got house price increases from 1991 to 2024 and projected these forward to work out how much these homes would cost from 2026 - 2058. These come from the Federal Housing Financing Agency</p>
