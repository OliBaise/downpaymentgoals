      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>We estimate your house price based on town-specific projections. The deposit needed is based on the percentage you select. We then calculate the amount you need to save monthly to reach that deposit by your target age. Mortgage payments are estimated based on your entered interest rate and loan length, and minimum required income is based on a 28% affordability rule.</p>
