      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>To work out starter home house prices in each area we looked at each area's median house price on Zillow and then multiplied this by 2/3. We then looked at how much house prices have changed from 1991-2024 on the Federal Housing Finance Agency and projected this forward to find out starter house prices from 2026 - 2058.</p>
